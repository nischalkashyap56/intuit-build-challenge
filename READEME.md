# Intuit Build Challenge Submission

Hello, this repository contains my solutions for the build challenge. Both assignments are done using Java 21.

I separated the projects into their own folders so it is easier to navigate:

* assignment-1 : producer-consumer - Contains the Producer-Consumer threading implementation
* assignment-2 : data-analytics - Contains the Data Analysis and Stream API implementation

Please go into each folder to see the specific README file. I put the detailed setup instructions, design decisions, and sample outputs inside those specific folders.

To run these you will need:
* Java 21 installed
* Maven
